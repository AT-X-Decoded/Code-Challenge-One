# Code Challenge One
## The First Summit

The journey begins here. This code challenge is to assess your skill level as well as how clean you can keep your code. Remember to comment and provide READMEs alongside your project.

You will have two paths to take. Whichever you choose, make the most out of it.

### Path One ###

*Option 1:* share some Python code you have written in the past. This
code must:

    * Be code you have permission to share -- i.e., don't share
      something you wrote for an employer.

    * Be written using Python 3.5 or later.

    * Be short: around 500 lines or fewer.

    * Be in a single file that I can run from the
      command line (something like `python your-code.py`)

    * If you have dependancies, include a `requirements.txt`.

*Option 2:* implement a solution to a coding exercise.

If you choose this, you'll implement a solution to the coding challenge
documented here: https://homework.adhoc.team/slcsp/.

**Don't submit the homework using the link there; follow the instructions
below to submit.**

Instructions are on that page, but there are a few extra instructions
specific to this application. Your code must:

    * Use Python 3.5 or later.

    * Be in a single file that I can run from the
      command line (something like `python your-code.py`)

    * If you have dependancies, include a `requirements.txt`.

This exercise shouldn't take you more than 2-3 hours. If it's taking much
longer, it's probably a sign your Python skill isn't where it needs to be
for this internship. I don't suggest spending much longer than that, as
it's probably not a good use of your time.

### Submitting your code ###

Whichever option you choose, follow these steps:

1. Post your code to a a private Gist (https://gist.github.com/). You'll
need a Github account for this (and you'll need one for the internship, so
might as well sign up now).

2. Submit this form: https://forms.gle/pVB2NEoTt5DnJ3A76.

### Due Date ###

Your code is due July 10th at 9am Pacific time (17:00 UTC)

To be fair to everyone, I can't consider submissions after that time.

### What will happen next ###

* I, along with a group of volunteers who also have experience hiring
developers, will review your applications -- both your code and the
original application you submitted. * We'll select some finalists, who will
be asked to hold a short video interview with me. I don't have a specific
number; but likely around 20-30. * From those finalists, I'll make a final
selection.

You should expect to hear back two weeks after submissions are closed.
